you will need to create two folders 
complaint_uniforms: add the school dress images
non_complaint uniforms: add casual images


****This project involves using face recognition to identify students
and check if they are wearing the correct uniform. 
The system will capture images using a webcam, preprocess them, 
use a trained model made by me to predict compliance, and send email notifications accordingly.**
FIRST :
Install Required Librariess
SECOND:
you need to collect images of each student for the face recognition model run the "data_preprocessor.py" file
THIRD:
After collecting images, you need to train the face recognition model, run the "face_model trainer.py"
FOURTH:
train the uniform model too by running "model training.py".

RUN THE FILE "app.py"
